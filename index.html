    <h1>About at <em>least</em> a few lizards</h1>
    <p>The next practice website said to make something for my pet, but I don't have one, so instead I'm going to make this page about lizards.</p>

    <h3>Leopard Gecko</h3>

    <p><strong>Leopard Geckos</strong> are among the easier types of lizards for people to take care of. They are fairly docile and small, as well as fairly robust, so they make a good beginner's pet.</p>
